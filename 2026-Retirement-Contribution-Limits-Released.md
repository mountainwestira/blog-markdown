## Introduction

The IRS has released the official 2026 contribution limits for IRAs, employer-sponsored plans, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and many of the increases provide meaningful opportunities for retirement savers, especially those nearing retirement age or self-employed individuals using SEP or Solo 401(k) structures. Whether you're contributing to a Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SIMPLE plan, SEP IRA, employer-sponsored 401(k), or preparing for medical costs through an HSA, understanding the new limits and deadlines can help you maximize tax-advantaged savings. Below is a breakdown of the updates you need to know for 2026 planning.

## Traditional & Roth IRA Contribution Limits

For 2026, the combined Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limit is **$7,500** for individuals under the age of 50 and **$8,600** for those age 50 or older. Income phase-out ranges for Roth IRAs have also increased. Deductibility for Traditional IRA contributions depends on income and whether you or your spouse participate in a workplace retirement plan. IRA contributions for 2026 can be made until **April 15, 2027**, and contributions made in the first quarter of 2027 may be designated for tax year 2026 if you have not already met the contribution limit.

## SEP IRA Limits for 2026

Self-employed individuals and business owners contributing to a SEP IRA may contribute up to **$72,000** in 2026 (based on eligible compensation formulas). Because SEP contributions are employer-only contributions, no catch-up contributions are allowed. SEP contributions follow the employer's tax return deadline, including extensions.

## SIMPLE IRA Limits

SIMPLE plans also receive increases for 2026. The employee deferral limit is **$17,000**, with a **$4,000 catch-up** contribution for those age 50 or older. Additionally, individuals ages **60–63** may take advantage of a higher **super catch-up contribution of $5,250**. SIMPLE employee deferrals must be completed by **December 31, 2026**, and employer contributions follow the rules set in the plan.

## 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and Solo 401(k) Contribution Limits

The 2026 **employee** deferral limit for 401(k), 403(b), and most 457(b) plans is **$24,500** for individuals under age 50. Those aged 50 or older may contribute up to **$32,500** total with catch-up contributions, while individuals ages **60–63** can contribute up to **$35,750** in employee deferrals due to the continued availability of the "super catch-up."

The IRS §415 annual addition limit (the combined employee and employer contribution cap) rises to **$72,000** for 2026. Importantly, **catch-up contributions are not included** in this limit. This means total contributions can reach **$80,000** for individuals aged 50+ and **$83,250** for those ages 60–63. This expanded headroom is especially beneficial for Solo 401(k) holders, who can maximize both employee and employer components.

## HSA Contribution Limits for 2026

HSAs remain a powerful tool for tax-advantaged savings, especially for those planning long-term healthcare expenses. For 2026, the HSA contribution limits increase to **$4,400** for individuals with self-only HDHP coverage and **$8,750** for those with family coverage. Individuals age 55 or older may also contribute an additional **$1,000** catch-up. Like IRAs, HSA contributions for 2026 can be made until **April 15, 2027**.

## 2026 Deadline Summary

Understanding deadlines is critical to preserving contribution eligibility:

### December 31, 2026
- 401(k) and SIMPLE employee deferrals
- Establishing a 2026 Solo 401(k)

## Planning Tips for 2026

- Confirm eligibility and rules for various account types.
- Take advantage of catch-up or super catch-up contributions if you are age 50+ or 60–63.
- Review income limits for IRA deductibility and Roth IRA qualification.
- Coordinate with your CPA or financial advisor, especially if self-employed or contributing to multiple plans.

## Self-Directed IRA Considerations

All IRS contribution rules apply the same to Self-Directed accounts. Investors must ensure all investment income and expenses flow through the retirement account, not personal funds. Prohibited transaction rules still apply, including restrictions involving disqualified persons, self-dealing, collectibles, and life insurance. Contributions made between January 1, and April 15, may be attributed as prior-year contributions when applicable.

## Final Thoughts

The 2026 contribution increases create meaningful opportunities for investors to maximize retirement and health savings across IRAs, employer plans, and HSAs. Always consult with your CPA, financial advisor, or tax professional to ensure contributions and investment decisions align with IRS rules and your overall retirement strategy.

Whether you're building a diversified portfolio through alternative assets or simply trying to boost long-term tax-advantaged growth, early planning can make a significant difference.
